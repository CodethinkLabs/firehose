  This example is for tracking Morph's master branch.  This way we no longer
  need to track morph manually for definitions.

landing:
  repo: baserock:baserock/definitions
  baseref: master
  myref: baserock/firehose
  stratum: tools
  chunk: morph
  method: absolute-sha1

tracking:
  mode: follow-tip
  ref: refs/heads/master
