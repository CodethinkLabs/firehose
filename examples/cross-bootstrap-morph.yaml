  This example is for tracking Morph's master branch.  This way we no longer
  need to track morph manually for definitions.  This entry updates the morph
  present in the cross-bootstrap.morph -- deliberately different so that we
  can see if changes work for normal builds but not cross-bootstrap or
  vice-versa.
