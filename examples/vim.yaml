  This is an example for tracking ViM tags.  We attempt to follow any
  tag which happens to be made and then we update the chunk listed in the
  tools stratum.

landing:
  repo: baserock:baserock/definitions
  baseref: master
  myref: ct-mcr-1/danielsilverstone/firehose-test-1
  stratum: tools
  chunk: vim
  method: absolute-sha1

tracking:
  mode: refs
  filters:
    - ^refs/tags/v[0-9]-[0-9]
  # Turns vX-YaZ into vX-Y~aZ so that tags can be usefully ordered
  transforms:
    - match: v([0-9]-[0-9])([^-].*)
      replacement: \1~\2
