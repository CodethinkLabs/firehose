Firehose
========

Firehose is a tool which reads yaml files (see the `examples/` directory) which
instruct the tool in how to perform integrations of upstream changes into a
Baserock definitions set.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with the
Baserock CD pipeline (Mason) to reduce the cognitive load on the systems
integration role, freeing brain cycles for more constructive development work.

Currently Firehose is limited to applying all of its inputs in a single
integration and it only supports the absolute-sha landing method (which assumes
a zero delta between upstream and what we need for Baserock) but for anything
where that holds true, Firehose can provide a valuable service pre-integrating
and running those integrations through a CD pipeline to gain confidence in the
proposed change.


Debian Version Comparison
=========================

The `debian/` directory contains a subset of the `python-debian` module which
is under the GPL and has its authors listed in the files themselves.
